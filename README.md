I put a dont sell licence (but free to distribure and use) in case I need money someday, or build a different version through a firm with money, then make that new version open source with more advanced AI features.

It is Windows only at the moment. There is no installer it is all in one folder. Its possible I missed some things about different aspect monitors and different resolutions. The most likly place I know this would mess up is the top left and right corners where I have mouse enter events. Left maximize right minimize. Bottom row should also minimize. Left click is menu. If theres problems start a Issue on the tab above.

There is some known issues with you tube music page pop ups like "reload page?" and "leave page" that I couldnt block.

I may add mouse over audio sample fun for freestyle song covers or whatever, and I might add audio visualizers soon.

It is not digitally signed so just ignore the windows warning. Its 100 on steam to sign it or more elsewhere if they accept the program. I may do that sometime. Microsoft defender doesnt pick up any problems. I didn't get a chance to scan it with anything else. Its possible that anti malware or virus scanners pick up something even though I didn't put any maleware or virus in it.

Currently I can only make the unity project open source if people have licenses to the assets I used in it (Vuplex WebView). About $150 worth.

Big thanks to all the package and editor creators!
