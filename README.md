# License stuff:

I put a don't sell license (but free to distribute and use) in case I want to roll over revenue to build a better open source version with alot more features. When I add more features and get a digital signature maybe I will charge 5 or so.

# Instructions:

It is a really simple to use program. The menu has only 5 buttons: Refresh Page, Reset Music Player, Play with Click, Next with Click, Settings.

Top left corner mouse enter is show window, top right corner mouse enter is hide window. Left click in top left corner is menu. Double click in the top right corner to turn on and off top left corner detection for a "Game Mode" for less interference with other programs. Esc will hide the window the same way top right corner does. Also the default global hotkeys are: Alt Shift F10 is Play/Pause toggle, Alt Shift F11 is play next song, Alt Shift F12 is play last song. I bind some of these to my mouse.

The clicks in the corner and inside the player do get blocked from the stuff underneath so you dont hit the x or the menu of things under it.

It works with my bluetooth headphone buttons (play/pause, next song, last song, volume).

If a valid link (music.youtube.com/watch and a valid youtube id which is on the share menu inside music.youtube.com) is on the clipboard when "play click" is pressed it loads that song for the click.

# Other stuff:

Check my website for examples of syncing with the movies! https://view-sync.com/

Google drive likes to put a warning like this "There was a problem with the preview." when downloading but you can still download it. This is just because it is not a video or song.

There is many things I could add! My favorite add ons would be mouse over audio samples with overlap and position so i could mouse over a array of sounds across the screen!
Image changers with beat, spectrum left/right, energy events and optional minimum delays for slideshow like stuff. Phasing and echo effects (this only works for user dropped in samples because of recursion)! EZ animated cutout of a mp4 or webm from the alpha channel of your webm. Full screen webm play on click with optional song. FX!

It is Windows only at the moment. There is no installer, it is all in one folder. Its possible I missed some things about different aspect monitors and different resolutions. If there's problems you can start a issue on the issues tab above.

It is not digitally signed so just ignore the windows warning. Its $100 on steam to sign it if they accept the program. I may do that sometime. Microsoft defender doesn't pick up any problems. I didn't get a chance to scan it with anything else. Its possible that anti malware or virus scanners pick up something even though I didn't put any malware or virus in it.

Currently I can only make the unity project open source if people have licenses to the assets I used in it (Vuplex WebView, Ultimate Sprite Shaders, Dot Tween). About $250 worth.

Big thanks to all the package and editor creators!
