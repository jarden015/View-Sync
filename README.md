I put a don't sell license (but free to distribute and use) in case I need money someday, or build a different version through a firm with money, then make that new version open source with more advanced with AI features.

It is set to be a always on top window that is transparent and click through (except colliders I put in the scene).

Instructions:

Top left corner mouse enter is show window, top right corner mouse enter is hide window. There is a 1 px bar on the bottom, on purpose, for windows taskbar to pop up. Left click in top left corner is menu. Also for now there is 3 static global hotkeys: Ctrl Alt Shift F10 is play next song, Ctrl Alt Shift F11 is play last song, Ctrl Alt Shift F12 is Play/Pause toggle. I bind these to my mouse.

I could not make the splash screen fullscreen because of the way the transparent screen work.

It is Windows only at the moment. There is no installer it is all in one folder. Its possible I missed some things about different aspect monitors and different resolutions. The most likely place I know this would mess up is the top left and right corners where I have mouse enter events. If there's problems with this start a issue on the tab above.

I may add mouse over audio sample fun for freestyle song covers or whatever, audio visualizers, and effects.

It is not digitally signed so just ignore the windows warning. Its $100 on steam to sign it if they accept the program. I may do that sometime. Microsoft defender doesn't pick up any problems. I didn't get a chance to scan it with anything else. Its possible that anti malware or virus scanners pick up something even though I didn't put any malware or virus in it.

Currently I can only make the unity project open source if people have licenses to the assets I used in it (Vuplex WebView). About $150 worth.

Big thanks to all the package and editor creators!
