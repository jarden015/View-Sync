# License stuff:

I put a don't sell license (but free to distribute and use) in case I need money someday, or build a different version through a firm with money, then make that new version open source with more advanced with AI features.

# Instructions:

Google drive likes to put a warning like this "There was a problem with the preview." but you can still download it. This is just because it is not a video or song.

Top left corner mouse enter is show window, top right corner mouse enter is hide window. Left click in top left corner is menu. Also for now there is 3 static global hotkeys: Ctrl Alt Shift F10 is play next song, Ctrl Alt Shift F11 is play last song, Ctrl Alt Shift F12 is Play/Pause toggle. I bind these to my mouse.

# Other stuff:

There is many things I could add! My favorite add ons would be mouse over audio samples with overlap and position so i could mouse over a array of sounds across the screen!
Image changers with beat, spectrum left/right, energy events and optional minimum delays for slideshow like stuff. Dominant tone phasing! EZ animated cutout of a mp4 or webm. FX!

It is set to be a always on top window that is transparent and click through (except colliders I put in the scene).

I could not make the splash screen fullscreen because of the way the transparent screen work.

It is Windows only at the moment. There is no installer, it is all in one folder. Its possible I missed some things about different aspect monitors and different resolutions. If there's problems you can start a issue on the issues tab above.

It is not digitally signed so just ignore the windows warning. Its $100 on steam to sign it if they accept the program. I may do that sometime. Microsoft defender doesn't pick up any problems. I didn't get a chance to scan it with anything else. Its possible that anti malware or virus scanners pick up something even though I didn't put any malware or virus in it.

Currently I can only make the unity project open source if people have licenses to the assets I used in it (Vuplex WebView). About $150 worth.

Big thanks to all the package and editor creators!
